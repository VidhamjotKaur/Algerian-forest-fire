## Objective

The aim is to:

- Process and clean the dataset.
- Generate visualizations.
- Derive insights from the Algerian forest fire dataset by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI).

## Analysis Techniques

The analysis will involve the following techniques:

1. **Multiple Linear Regression**
2. **Polynomial Regression**
3. **Regularization Models**

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, the following steps will be undertaken:

- **Cross-Validation**: Ensuring the model's robustness by testing it on different subsets of the data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model's parameters for better accuracy.

## Model Development

After developing the model, the following steps will be performed:

- **Creating Pickle Files**: Saving the model for future use.
- **Testing on Unseen Data**: Validating the model's performance on new, unseen data.
